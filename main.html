	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, allowing it to process data quickly.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It is often denoted as <b>O(n)</b>, where <b>n</b> represents the input size. Optimizing space complexity ensures efficient memory usage.</p>
